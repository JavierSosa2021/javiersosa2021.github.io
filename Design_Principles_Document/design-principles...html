        I think This is a interesting example of proper usage of the Rule of the Thirds.
        <br>
        I heavily based my assumptions from an introduciton by CXL which can be read <a
          href="https://cxl.com/blog/universal-web-design-principles/">here.</a>
        I based this on the fact that the site displays its images following closely but not perfectly the rule of
        thirds. It positions individual images in your results following the third rule and putting one image per
        quadrant in the 9 quadrants.
        Occasionaly there is a larger image that breaks the rule but starting at the next image it continues following
        the rule.

      <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>

      <h3>Google</h3>

      <p> This site can be found at <a href="http://www.google.com">this link</a></p>
      <p>
        I think This is a great example of proper white space usage as detailed by proper white space design
        Principles.
        <br>
        I heavily based my assumptions from an introduciton by Ux Engineer which can be read <a
          href="https://uxengineer.com/principles-of-design/white-space/">here.</a>
        since the site is consistent with its spacing around smaller components and provided extra white space around
        the primary search field to draw attention to it above the rest of the page.

      <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
      <h3>Ebay</h3>

      <p> This site can be found at <a href="http://www.ebay.com">this link</a></p>
      <p>
        I think this is a great example of proper application of hick's law.
        <br>
        They presented front and center there must important search tool, aka text search.
        Ebay also presented for easy access the first few categories it found must useful for me.
        Granted the categories aren't always handy but it is also only a swipe and a click to get to in detail
        categories if i need a specific one.
